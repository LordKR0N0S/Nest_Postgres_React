# Nest_Postgres_React

I have successfully completed a project using the Nest.js framework, along with React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for the database.

Technologies Used:
Nest.js: I chose Nest.js as the backend framework for its scalability and clean architecture. It allowed me to develop a secure and efficient backend for my application.

React: For the frontend, I used React, a popular and powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces. Its component-based structure made it easier to develop the frontend of my application.

PostgreSQL: I utilized PostgreSQL as the database management system to store and manage data for my application. Its reliability and robust features ensured the integrity of the data.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): JWTs provided a secure and efficient way to handle user authentication and authorization within the application.

Conclusion
In just two days, I successfully completed this project using a combination of Nest.js, React, and PostgreSQL. The application includes essential features like authentication, authorization, and state management using Redux Toolkit. This project serves as a testament to my ability to efficiently deliver a full-stack application within a tight timeframe.
